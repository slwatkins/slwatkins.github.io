### Education

2016 - Present, *University of California, Berkeley*
 - Ph.D. Candidate - Department of Physics
 
2016 - 2018, *University of California, Berkeley*
 - M.A. - Department of Physics

2011 - 2015, *University of California, Los Angeles*
 - B.S. - Department of Physics, Magna Cum Laude
 - Minor in Applied Mathematics

### Research and Work Experience

2017 - Present, *University of California, Berkeley*, Department of Physics
 - Graduate Student Researcher under Assistant Professor Matt C. Pyle
 - Member of SuperCDMS and SPICE/HeRALD dark matter detection collaborations
 - Performed low-temperature detector R&D in a state-of-the-art dilution refrigerator, from installation of ultra-sensitive Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) based detectors, setup and readout via SQUIDs, to design and implementation of a passive vibration isolation system to reduce noise from pulse-tube cryocooler vibrations
 - Executed a complex and novel light dark matter search analysis (SuperCDMS-CPD DM Search) taking raw data, extracting relevant features, and achieving a world-leading cryogenic dark matter exclusion limit, created a substantial majority of the Python analysis code from scratch, and successfully wrote an academic paper that was accepted by Physical Review Letters and spawned vigorous scientific interest in the community
 - Creator and maintainer of [QETpy](https://github.com/ucbpylegroup/QETpy) and [RQpy](https://github.com/ucbpylegroup/RQpy) open-source Python packages, which have become pivotal tools for our group and scientific collaborators
 - Organized and chaired meetings to develop statistical tools and methods for developing reusable and easily readable tools and providing guidance for collaborators on applicability of statistical techniques

2015 - 2016, *PNI Sensor Corporation*, Santa Rosa, California
 - Physicist and algorithm engineer, working primarily in MATLAB
 - Created algorithms to leverage data from onboard phone sensors and GPS in order to provide real time navigation in scenarios of intermittent GPS outages and general improvement upon current location
 - Spearheaded Kalman filter-based algorithms using pedestrian dead reckoning data and trilateration of multiple stationary radio-frequency beacons to provide real time indoor locating and performed live tests of the system for potential investors
 - Interfaced with the Android API to extract raw sensor data from smartphones and discerned which data were of importance for various applications of sensor fusion algorithms
