I am a Physicist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, working in the Detection Physics group.

Previously, I was a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory, working as a member of the LEGEND and SPLENDOR collaborations. In LEGEND, I led the Beyond-Standard-Model physics search working group, where we searched for new physics beyond neutrinoless double beta decay. In SPLENDOR, I aided in the search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors, where I led the data acquisition efforts and the analysis pipeline.

I completed my PhD in the physics department at UC Berkeley as a member of the [Pyle Group](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/pylegroup) where I helped our group in the goal to detect dark matter (DM). I am also a member of the SuperCDMS and SPICE/HeRALD dark matter detection collaborations.

Throughout the course of my PhD at Berkeley, I have had a hand in many different aspects of our lab. I was the lead analyzer and corresponding author of the SuperCDMS-CPD DM search, which was subsequently published in Physical Review Letters as ["Light Dark Matter Search with a High-Resolution Athermal Phonon Detector Operated above Ground."](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.061801) In this analysis, I took raw DM search data and wrote Python code for feature extraction, event simulation, and exclusion limit setting. Most of these tools have been included in the open-source Python packages [QETpy](https://github.com/spice-herald/QETpy) and [`detprocess`](https://github.com/spice-herald/detprocess), and [DarkLim](https://github.com/spice-herald/DarkLim), for each of which I am a creator and maintainer.

I have also been directly involved in the day-to-day running of our lab's cryogen-free dilution refrigerator, which operates at temperatures below 10 mK. I have installed and characterized various transition-edge sensor based detectors, from simple rectangles to distributed sensor arrays. I also am working on the passive vibration isolation system that will be used to make the vibrational background from the pulse-tube cryocooler negligible.
